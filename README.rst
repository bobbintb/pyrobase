*General Python Helpers and Utilities.*

.. contents:: **Contents**


What is it?
-----------

``pyrobase`` assembles general Python helper functions and classes that
can be applied to any project. That includes some additional tasks
for the Paver build tool, an improved xmlrpc2scgi module, unit test
helpers, and generic base modules for various domains.

All modules have unit tests (currently pyrobase.paver is an exception),
and the goal is to reach >80% coverage.
