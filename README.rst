What is it?
-----------

``pyrobase`` assembles general Python helper functions and classes that
can be applied to any project. That includes some additional tasks
for the Paver build tool, an improved xmlrpc2scgi module, unit test
helpers, and generic base modules for various domains.

All modules have unit tests (currently pyrobase.paver is an exception),
and the goal is to reach >80% coverage.

Installation
------------

Install it with ``pip install --user pyrobase``, or more commonly just add
it as a dependency to your project and call ``python setup.py develop -U``.
Installing into a virtualenv is recommended.


Usage
-----

See the project's ``pavement.py`` and unit tests, and for a full API
documentation go to http://packages.python.org/pyrobase/.
